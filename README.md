This is a *very* primitive disassembly of Acornsoft ISO Pascal v1.10 for the BBC Micro/Acorn Electron. The goal of the disassembly was just to understand the code enough to try combining the two ROMs into a single 32K "Computer Concepts"-style PALPROM.

The ROMs and associated discs were obtained from [stardot](https://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=350313#p350313).
